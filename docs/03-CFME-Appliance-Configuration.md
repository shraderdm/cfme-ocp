# CFME Appliance configuration
Once you've deployed the database appliance, navigate to the database appliance's web console.
* Settings --> Configuration
## Server Configuration
For each appliance, do the following
1. Provide a **Company Name** (e.g. MyCompany)
2. Provide an **Appliance Name** (e.g. CFMEDB)
3. Set your timezone
4. Apply the **Server Roles**.  Please note these are only recommended settings.

5. Configure e-mail (if desired, but I recommend it).  I used Gmail in this example.
  * Host: smtp.gmail.com
  * Port: 587
  * Domain: gmail.com
  * Start TLS Automatically: On
  * SSL Verify Mode: None
  * Authentication: login
  * User Name: *Your Gmail login with the @gmail.com*
  * Password: Your gmail application Password
  * From E-mail Address: This could be anything

## Tags
We need to add some tags to affect how OCP projects are provisioned.
* Settings --> Configuration
In the pane on the left, choose the appropriate **CFME Region: Region N [N]**.  There may be only one.  

When creating tags, we must first create some categories.

| Name  | Description | Long Description | Show in Console | Single Value | Capture C&U Data by Tag |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| quota_ocp_pods | Quota OCP Pods | Quota OCP Pods | On | On | Off |
| quota_ocp_pvc | Quota OCP Persistent Volume Claims | Quota OCP Persistent Volume Claims | On | On | Off |
| quota_ocp_rc | Quota OCP Replication Controller Count | Quota OCP Replication Controller Count | On | On | Off |
| quota_ocp_secrets | Quota OCP Secrets | Quota OCP Secrets | On | On | Off |
| quota_ocp_services | Quota OCP Services | Quota OCP Services | On | On | Off |
| ldap_manager_attribute | LDAP Manager Attribute | LDAP Manager Attribute | On | On | Off |
| ldap_username_attribute | LDAP User Name Attribute | LDAP User Name Attribute | On | On | Off |
| ocp_project_role | Default Requester Project Role | Default Requester Project Role | On | On | Off |

Now we can add values to the tags.  For each of the categories above, create the following **recommended** values.

### Quota OCP Pods

## Applying the tags
Each of the above tags get applied to a group.  Groups are configured under **Access Control**.
* Settings --> Configuration --> Access Control

Under **Groups** select the group to which to apply the tags.  Then go to **Policy** at the top and select the *Edit <Company> Tags for this Group*.
